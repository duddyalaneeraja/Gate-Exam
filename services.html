          <h3> <center> About exam</center></h3>
                    <p> Unlike undergraduate admissions in India, candidates must apply individually to each institute after the institute has published its M.Tech. notification (usually in the month of March). There is no separate counselling held. For admissions in NIT's and IIIT's, CCMT is held every year and the notification is released around April of each year.[33]

            Some institutions specify GATE qualification as mandatory even for admission of self-financing 
            students to postgraduate programs. GATE qualified candidates are also eligible for the award of
             Junior Research Fellowship in CSIR Laboratories and CSIR sponsored projects. Top rank holders in
              some GATE papers are entitled to apply for "Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Fellowship" awarded by CSIR.
               Some government organizations prescribe GATE qualification as a requirement for applying to the
                post of a Scientist/Engineer.
            
            In recent years, various academicians have recognized GATE as being one of the toughest exams in
             its category. Some non-Indian universities like the National University of Singapore, Nanyang 
             Technological University in Singapore and some technical universities in Germany also identify
              GATE score as a parameter for judging the quality of the candidates for admission into their
               Masters and Ph.D. programs. </p>

          Helps in Understanding Paper - Practicing previous year GATE papers will help the candidates to understand the type and level of questions asked in the exam. ... Practicing more and more previous year papers like this will help the candidates in increasing the speed and time management skills.
          So, even 1 is enough. For those who have good grip in the subjects, solving three papers of GATE 2014 is enough. ... Only for those who prepare solely from previous GATE papers, I encourage to solve papers before 2010. And I have found that many questions from 1991-1998 to be bit tough.
